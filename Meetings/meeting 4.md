# Notes: 

Environments will be set first with the core project team: economical levels, principles, value system.  

- Stable principles/key basic values that we need to have and then build on top of it
- By creating too stable metrics we make the game to be finite. At the moment, the structure and model doesn’t have any absolutes
- In flow and very flexible, everything creative and experimential 
- A sandbox for others to play
- Etno (thinking about your tribe, community) and egocentric ( personal success, growth, rationality)  

Is the land defined and divided for the communities? 
- Yes, we already have the master plan - 5 communities land is defined. 

The contract for the land?
- Renting the land for the next 25 years.  

Can we do our own filming and broadcasting? 
- Yes, we can film and do our own social media streams and filming.
- There are no strict rules and guidelines from Netflix. 
- We have a filming licence for the land, backing the creations of buildings, camp, installations as part of the experiment.  

Is land size per community confirmed? 
- 30 ara for housing
- there will be an extra space for common area too

Pillars:
- sustainable materials,eco-friendly, solar panels, etc. 
- shared among communities - water, electricity

Sample of an economic model:
- Main stakeholders - investors, managers, and clients. 
- Focus on monetization and financial sustainability
- Core layers - master planning, common layers
- Sublayer - separate entity - “restaurant” is a client of a core layer, client is a client of the core layer
- Impact investors is a good example of our segment. The conditions for an investor - invest to core, managers doing work to return % of profits to investors, and another pie of profits will go to a fund (centric to community, core client, partner/manager, investor) which will have a governance mechanism (investors, managers, and clients will be involved in the voting)

To be defined:  
- What kind of an environment will be there?  
- What are the success metrics for our project?  
- Economics in place?  
- What kind of social vibe, filtering behavior?  

**Main focus and goals by Feb:** designing space, building constructions, creating groups, very early system/people filtering: goals of the community and values.

**Communities teams have to think about:** principles - for the whole society and our community, who should be there in the 1st game, architectural forms. 

**Next Meeting: Jan 12th - meetings with community leaders and teams as a starting point to collaborate.**
