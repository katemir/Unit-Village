# Notes: 

Environments will be set first with the core project team: economical levels, principles, value system. - Stable principles/key basic values that we need to have and then build on top of it. 

By creating too stable metrics we make the game to be finite. At the moment, the structure and model doesn’t have any absolutes - in flow and very flexible, everything creative and experimenta - a sandbox for others to play - etno (thinking about your tribe, community) and egocentric ( personal success, growth, rationality). 

Is the land defined and divided for the communities? 
- Ye, we already have the master plan - 5 communities, close to the sea, golden ratio design, more feminine. 

The contract for the land?
Existent rent of the land for the next 25 years. 
Can we do our own filming and broadcasting? 
Yes, we can film and do our own social media streams and filming. There are no strict rules and guidelines from Netflix. We have a filming licence for the land - backing the creations of buildings, camp, installations as part of the experiment. 

Land size per community? 
30 ara for housing
there will be an extra space for common area too


Pillars:
sustainable materials,eco-friendly, solar panels, etc. 
shared among communities - water, electricity

Sample of an economic model:
Main stakeholders - investors, managers, and clients. 
Focus on pure monetised models
Core layers - master planning, common layers
Sublayer - separate entity - “restaurant” is a client of a core layer, client is a client of the core layer
Impact investors is a good example of our segment. The conditions for an investor - invest to core, managers doing work to return % of profits to investors, and other profit will go to a fund (centric to community, core client, partner/manager, investor) which will have a governance mechanism (investors, managers, and clients will be involved in the voting)

To be defined:
What kind of an environment will be there?
What are the success metrics for our project? 
Economics in place?
What kind of social vibe, filtering behavior?

Main focus and goals by Feb: designing space, building constructions, creating groups, very early system/people filtering: goals of the community and values.

Communities teams have to think about: principles - for the whole society and our community, who should be there in the 1st game, architectural forms. 

Next Meeting: Jan 12th - meetings with community leaders and teams as a starting point to collaborate.
